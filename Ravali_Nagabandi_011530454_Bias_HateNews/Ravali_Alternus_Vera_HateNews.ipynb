honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families, regardless of race, age, character or knowledge. the outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the witzeman. for those who have ever been a witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. a person may not now they were a witzeman for many years, until they are called by former witzemans via dreams. associates of the witzeman are known to be a certain babe cool or the much lesser known witzewoman.\\n\\nthe present witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely benjamin woods, who is said to have become a witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. he has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.\\n\\n                           history\\nthe present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the witzeman in present years, because former witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. the term 'witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. unfortuneatly, witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.\\n\\n                       proper history\\nas early as the 14th century, witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. this led to the 1st witzeman rebellion of 1555 when the current witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local council chess team. this rebellion further disgraced the witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a government meeting that year. the period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the witzemans history. however good times were to come for the witzeman. many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the great rebellion of 1988. this was when several witzeman sprinted round the visitors gallery of the house of commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. this was thought to be an act of circambulation. however many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. this group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. it was at this time that the government finally took positive action for the witzeman. in 1990, a bill of rights for the witzeman was signed, stating all witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the government to the witzeman, as the behaviour of the witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.\",\n",

Äiurlionis is the best example here. \\nin other way, the later lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce western european ideas into lithuanian cultural life (see the table below). \\nwe see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. the problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen. so, many researchers don\\'t pay attention to this difference. especially in the soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed. e. g. philosopher ramÅ«nas bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal. and it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism).\\n \\n\\n period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of lithuania in an european context the national renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 â 1930  painter and composer  Äiurlionis, painter kazys Å¡imonis, poet and philosopher vilius storastas - vydÅ«nas, dramatist sofija kymantaitÄ - ÄiurlionienÄ, poets adomas jakÅ¡tas, motiejus gustaitis, liudas gira, composer stasys Å¡imkus, philosopher ramÅ«nas bytautas.  reformers and innovators of lithuanian culture representatives of lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them. the period between wwi and wwii and post-war years.   poets v mykolaitis - putinas, kazys binkis, writer ignas Å¡einius â jurkÅ«nas, artists: all \\'ars\\' group,  philosopher juozas girnius  modernists, introducing new western ideas into lithuanian cultural life  central european modernism. \\nnote: lists of personalities isn\\'t complete here, nor it\\'s made precisely by prominence. \\n 07:51, 2004 jul 16 (utc)\\n\\n\"',\n",

       " '\":::::::::: tim, firstly i appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour. yes i certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the french or japanese jurisdictions, or between the chinese and u.s. jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets.\\n\\n beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, paris or toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction. i appreciate that the situation in the u.s. is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions. even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though. to give an example, the san jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the los angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech. \\n\\n to give another example, in the uk a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn\\'t have an office in london, even if it had offices in every other big city. in fact all of the very top tier uk firms (dla piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one uk office, in london, although they have other offices overseas. \\n\\n saying that dla has \"\" has 69 offices across the united states, egypt, south africa, kenya, thailand, china, ...\"\" would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader. we could fall back on using descriptions like \"\"in major financial centres\"\" or \"\"in major commercial centres\"\" or \"\"in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres\"\" but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research.\\n\\n i do accept that dla, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article. however i do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible.  \\n\\n\"',\n",

honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families, regardless of race, age, character or knowledge. the outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the witzeman. for those who have ever been a witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. a person may not now they were a witzeman for many years, until they are called by former witzemans via dreams. associates of the witzeman are known to be a certain babe cool or the much lesser known witzewoman.\\n\\nthe present witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely benjamin woods, who is said to have become a witzeman after he felt this \\'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek\\'. he has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.\\n\\n                           history\\nthe present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the witzeman in present years, because former witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. the term \\'witzeman\\' is a compound word of the adjective witze and \\'man\\', witze being an 11th century term for \\'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence\\'. unfortuneatly, witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.\\n\\n                       proper history\\nas early as the 14th century, witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. this led to the 1st witzeman rebellion of 1555 when the current witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local council chess team. this rebellion further disgraced the witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced \\'gaga\\' at a government meeting that year. the period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the witzemans history. however good times were to come for the witzeman. many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the great rebellion of 1988. this was when several witzeman sprinted round the visitors gallery of the house of commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. this was thought to be an act of circambulation. however many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were \\'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life\\'. this group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. it was at this time that the government finally took positive action for the witzeman. in 1990, a bill of rights for the witzeman was signed, stating all witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the government to the witzeman, as the behaviour of the witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted. \"\\n\\nok: just finished my planned cleanup of the todo page. the entries that were removed were copied to the investigated
